Requirements:
- The variables must be declared before they are used
- The variables must have matching types when used in arithmetic expressions (this is a big part of semantic analysis called type checking that we’ll cover separately)
- There should be no duplicate declarations (Pascal prohibits, for example, having a local variable in a procedure with the same name as one of the procedure’s formal parameters)
- A name reference in a call to a procedure must refer to the actual declared procedure
- A procedure call must have the correct number of arguments and the arguments’ types must match those of formal parameters in the procedure declaration
- Utilize the symbol table and check if the symbol exists in it

Info we need to collect about varibles:

Name, category, and type. And we utilize the symbols to hold that information.

Information is stored:

symbols are stored in the symbol table by using its insert method.
